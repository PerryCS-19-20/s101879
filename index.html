    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I tend to procrastinate due to minor depression.</li>
      <li>I have a very peacefull outlook when dealing with situations and confrontations.</li>
      <li>I can be smart and wise but I Always forget to follow my own advice, Ex: If some one desires to better them self, one must welcome adversity and challenge, they will improove ones' skill.</li>
      <li>I don't trust others that have not told me about themselves, the more open a person is the more trustworthy they are to me.</li>
      <li>Videogames are like an art form to me, from the coding to concept arts, there are some people who can make games with such attention to detail that it would bring me to tears if the developer or artist were to quit</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    I would love to learn the basics of coding and webdesign so that later on in life I will have the basics covered and I can further develop my abilitys in this feild.
